Mood Tracking for Mobile Devices

## Description ##

This app was developed to be used as a tool with **Cognitive Behavioural Therapy** to log how the mood of the patient had been during the week.

Stores data for the last week (last 7 days). The currently stored dataset can be viewed in an overview graph on the `Review Mood` page.

## How to use it ##

1. Each day open the app from the App menu
2. Log how your mood has been during the day from `0` to `10`, 
   where `0` is the worst possible mood and `10` is the best possible mood.
  * The preferred range can be changed from the settings page
3. Then press the Back button (or go to a different page) to store the mood.
4. If you need to change the mood after it was logged, you can change the mood 
   at any time during the day by repeating the steps `1` - `3`. You can also change the mood of past days.
5. If you want to view the mood progress during the last week, go to the `Review Mood` page.
    * Here you can view how the mood has changed during the last week in a overview graph.
    * You can also see the average and the median for the mood during the last week.
